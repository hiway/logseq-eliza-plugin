# Logseq Eliza Plugin

Your private Rogerian therapist at your Logseq

## Excerpt from (https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/):

ELIZA is a natural language conversation program described by Joseph Weizenbaum in January 1966 [1].
It features the dialog between a human user and a computer program representing a mock Rogerian psychotherapist.
The original program was implemented on the IBM 7094 of the Project MAC time-sharing system at MIT and was written in MAD-SLIP.

This is how Joseph Weizenbaum discussed his choice for a conversation model 
as it would be found in psychotherapist's session:

> At this writing, the only serious ELIZA scripts which exist 
> are some which cause ELIZA to respond roughly as would certain psychotherapists (Rogerians). 
> ELIZA performs best when its human correspondent is initially instructed to "talk" to it, 
> via the typewriter of course, just as one would to a psychiatrist. 
> This mode of conversation was chosen because the psychiatric interview 
> is one of the few examples of categorized dyadic natural language communication 
> in which one of the participating pair is free to assume the pose of knowing 
> almost nothing of the real world. 
> If, for example, one were to tell a psychiatrist "I went for a long boat ride" 
> and he responded "Tell me about boats", one would not assume 
> that he knew nothing about boats, but that he had some purpose 
> in so directing the subsequent conversation. 
> It is important to note that this assumption is one made by the speaker. 
> Whether it is realistic or not is an altogether separate question. 
> In any case, it has a crucial psychological utility in that it serves the speaker 
> to maintain his sense of being heard and understood. 
> The speaker furher defends his impression (which even in real life may be illusory) 
> by attributing to his conversational partner all sorts of background knowledge, 
> insights and reasoning ability. 
> But again, these are the speaker's contribution to the conversation.
